          <p>Life Is Spiritual Ministries (LIS) is a non denominational christian discipleship ministry with a goal to see the gospel of the Kingdom of God spread to the entire world. This ministry was founded by Apostle Timsimon "Bamboo" Kimani and Erica Kimani. Tim is married to Erica Kimani and is a family man and a man of God. We believe that there are many deep and wonderful truths hidden in the bible which God's children need to know. Unfortunately, many of these truths are not revealed by the mainstream christian church through televangelists because of the level of compromise and infiltration of the enemy into positions of media leadership.

Therefore the enemy is able to conceal many of his deceptions to the world because his agents are some of the popular ministers with access to the world through the media. Now there are many men of God who have not been compromised however, these men seem to have no voice or have been silenced before they could reach many souls in the world with the truth. The body of Christ needs their own platforms where the evil arms of censorship and/or infiltration cannot reach. Satan's kingdom is a kingdom of darkness. Darkness is ignorance, therefore Satan's kingdom thrives on the ignorance of humanity. The more a born again human being declares the light of God's word, the less space the devil has to move around. Matthew 5:14 "Ye are the light of the world, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid." </p>
